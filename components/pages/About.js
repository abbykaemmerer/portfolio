    <p class="about">
        Currently, I work as a developer for a IT consulting firm based in St. Louis. My team is contracted to MasterCard where we work mostly with AngularJS, Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BitBucket, Jenkins, ALM, and Swagger.
        <br><br>
        After graduating from the University of Missouri with a degree in Fisheries and Wildlife, I worked as a research technician for a few years before deciding to further my education by enrolling in a Front-End Development bootcamp.
        <br><br>
        The SavvyCoders bootcamp was a swift and intense dive into the coding world. We learned JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, version control, GitHub, Netlify, Trello and ultimately how to put together and code our own projects.
        <br><br>
        From my education and professional experiences, I have learned how to optimize my time while working with many different teams and people. My experiences have taught me to be persistent, curious and efficient while also maintaining my creativity and passion for web development.
